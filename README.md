# Higher Studies Prediction Project
This project is completed. This is basically a web application built for predicting and analyzing the chances of admission to a particular university. Through this system we aim to predict the chances of admission of a student to a particular university by taking into consideration hisher GRE scores, CGPA etc.
In addition to predicting chances of admission we also created a recommender which can be used to recommend ten universities to students according to their score.
